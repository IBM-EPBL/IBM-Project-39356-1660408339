Real-Time River Water Quality Monitoring and Control System

                                   This paper proposes a sensor-based water quality monitoring system. The main components of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) include a microcontroller
for processing the system, communication system for inter and intra node communication and several sensors. Real-time data access can be done by using remote monitoring 
and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Data collected at the apart site can be displayed in a visual format on a server PC with the help of Spark streaming analysis 
through Spark MLlib, Deep learning neural network models, Belief Rule Based (BRB) system and is also compared with standard values. If the acquired value is above the 
threshold value automated warning SMS alert will be sent to the agent. The uniqueness of our proposed paper is to obtain the water monitoring system with high frequency,
high mobility, and low powered. Therefore, our proposed system will immensely help people to become conscious against contaminated water as well as to stop polluting the 
water.The essential parameters of the water quality vary based on the application of water. For example, for aquariums, it is necessary to maintain the temperature, pH 
level, dissolved oxygen level, turbidity, and the level of the water in a certain normal range in order to ensure the safety of the fish inside the aquarium. For the 
industrial and household applications, however, some parameters of the water are more essential tobe monitored frequently than the others, depending on the usage of the 
water.The traditional method for monitoring of the water quality is such that the water sample is taken and sent to the laboratory to be tested manually by analytical methods.
Although by this method the chemical, physical, and biological agents of the water can be analyzed, it has several drawbacks. Firstly, it is time consuming and labor intensive.
Secondly, the cost for this controlled, displayed, and transferred. Compared to the conventional water quality testing techniques, sensor based water quality testing has many 
advantages such as accurate, high sensitivity, good selectivity, speed, fast response, low cost etc.
